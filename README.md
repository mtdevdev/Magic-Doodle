<h1 align="center">Magic Doodle</h1>

<p align="center">A creative animation tool built with AI assistance — from code to interface.</p>

<hr>


This web application stands as a testament to the power of **AI-assisted development**. Approximately **95% of this application's code was generated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro**. My role was to act as a **director and editor**, guiding the AI through a **~10-hour process of continuous prompting, testing, and making fine-tune adjustments** to integrate the generated code into a cohesive and fully functional application, yielding a final codebase of 1,300+ lines of code.

## 🛠️ The Development Process & Technologies
The technology stack was chosen and implemented by **Gemini 2.5 Pro** based on my high-level requirements.
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and modern **JavaScript (ES6+)** form the foundation of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used via CDN to rapidly style the user interface.
- **Self-Contained Code:** The entire application logic, styling, and structure are encapsulated within a single `index.html` file, demonstrating a lightweight, dependency-free approach.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Open** the `index.html` file (or the website) in any modern web browser.
2. **Start drawing!**
