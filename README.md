# Magic Doodle

This web application stands as a testament to the power of AI-assisted development. Approximately 95% of this application's code was generated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro.
My role was to act as a director and editor, guiding the AI through a 10-hour process of continuous prompting, testing, and making fine-tune adjustments to integrate the generated code into a cohesive and fully functional application.

🛠️ The Development Process & Technologies
This project is a prime example of human-AI collaboration. The technology stack was chosen and implemented by Gemini 2.5 Pro based on my high-level requirements.
    HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+) form the foundation of the application.
    Tailwind CSS: Was used via its CDN to rapidly style the user interface.
    Self-Contained Code: The entire application logic, styling, and structure are encapsulated within a single index.html file, demonstrating a lightweight, dependency-free approach.
